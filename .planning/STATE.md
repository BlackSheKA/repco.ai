## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Day 1: Register Reddit OAuth app immediately — 2-4 week pre-approval window
- Stack: Next.js 15 (not 14) — Fluid Compute gives 800s timeout, eliminates Railway concern
- Action engine is highest technical risk — build Phase 3 early, validate in beta
- Anti-ban warmup (Phase 3) must complete before any DM outreach
- [Phase 01]: 12 ENUM types for all constrained PRD schema columns; ON DELETE CASCADE on user FKs, SET NULL on job_logs
- [Phase 01]: Anon SELECT on live_stats and public intent_signals for /live page; action_counts RLS via social_accounts subquery

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Reddit OAuth app approval takes 2-4 weeks — register immediately or Phase 2 is blocked
- GoLogin CDP compatibility drift is HIGH severity — wrap in adapter pattern from day 1
- Haiku CU 56% benchmark confidence — enforce max 15 steps + stuck detection (3 identical screenshots)
